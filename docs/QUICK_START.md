# Quick Start For Users

If you're here, you're probably looking for an easy way to manage your tools and keep them in sync between your CAM software and CNC machines.  If that's what you need, you've come to the right place.  

But first a word of warning.  Smooth Core does not have a user interface.  It is a REST API and database tool which is meant to be the back-end for more user-facing tools (clients).

For hobbyists and casual users, The quickest way to get started is to get a free account at [loobric.com](https://loobric.com).  

Then use one of the clients to connect your software to your account.

## But I hate cloud hosted solutions!  

If you don't want to use a cloud hosted solution, you can run Smooth Core yourself.  
Check out the [deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) guide for how to do that.
