Unit tests for authorization and permission checking.

Tests scope-based permissions, data isolation, and authorization helpers.

Assumptions:
- Scopes follow pattern: "read", "write:<entity>", "delete:<entity>", "admin:<entity>"
- Read scope allows listing/viewing any entity
- Write scope allows create/update for specific entity type
- Delete scope allows deletion for specific entity type
- Admin scope allows all operations for specific entity type
- Users can only access their own data (user_id filtering)
- Admins can access all data
