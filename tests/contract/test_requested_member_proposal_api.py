"""Contract tests for the request-aware binding bridge (ROUNDTRIP_FIXES Fix 2 /
S3, issue #39).

When `POST /tool-table-entry-records/sync` creates a NEW UNBOUND entry on a
machine that has a bound set with a `requested` member (an asserted preferred
tool_number, no entry yet), the server opens a high-confidence binding proposal
naming that member's instance, with reason "requested via set <name>". This is
the bridge that turns a freshly-mounted tool into a binding — closing the
ROUNDTRIP loop (docs/ROUNDTRIP.md steps 8-9).

When nothing ties the new entry to a request, it falls back to the existing
geometry heuristic, behaving exactly as today.
