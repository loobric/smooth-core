"""The gate: the published surface speaks ONLY the facade vocabulary.

`UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` ("Language rule — the gate") and `REBOOT.md` (R2) promise
three things this file enforces in CI so drift cannot recur:

1. The legacy deep-schema routers are LIVE but UNPUBLISHED — they must never
   appear in the published OpenAPI paths. (The glossary long *claimed* this was a
   tested contract; until the 2026-06-18 reboot it was not. Now it is.)
2. The concepts ripped out in the reboot — adopt / coverage / reconcile / mirror —
   never reappear on a public *path* or as a removed-*endpoint* call in a client.
3. The rejected *words* never reappear as user-facing TEXT in the bundled clients
   (button labels, help, toasts). This closes REBOOT R11 — the original gate only
   checked endpoint paths, so a web-UI "Adopt" button that correctly called
   `/bind` still shipped the dead word, and `--slot` reached the CLI the same way.
   The vocabulary scan below catches the word, not just the route.

If one of these fails, drift reached the surface. Fix the code, not this test.
