"""
Fixtures for the v2 facade contract tests.

Assumptions:
- Solo mode is activated by the SMOOTH_SOLO=1 environment variable (G1/D1):
  the server boots with a built-in solo user and unauthenticated requests
  act as that user. No registration, login, or API-key ceremony.
- The solo_client fixture is the contract: if solo mode's activation
  mechanism changes, this fixture (and the docs) change together.
