"""Server-driven integration test for the ROUNDTRIP loop (docs/ROUNDTRIP.md
steps 5-10, the acceptance test in docs/ROUNDTRIP_FIXES.md "Fix 2").

This drives the *real* API endpoints the clients use (entry `/sync`, `/bind`,
set create/assert/members, `/refresh`, set GET) and proves the loop closes:

    machine + bound set in sync at 17
      -> programmer adds a tool          (member reads `requested`, still in sync)
      -> operator mounts it + sync        (new unbound entry; member `pending bind`,
                                           a binding proposal names its instance)
      -> bind confirms                    (member `loaded`, number observed)
      -> every view converges on 18.

It exercises the #37 (reconcile/state) + #38 (refresh-is-a-merge) + #39
(request-aware binding bridge) slices together as one narrative.
