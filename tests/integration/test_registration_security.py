Integration tests for user registration.

Tests the open-registration model:
- First user registration is open and creates an admin
- Subsequent registrations are also open and create standard "user" accounts

This is the deliberate posture for the public sandbox (api.loobric.com): anyone
may create an account without an invite. The first user still becomes admin; no
one after them does, and open registration grants no elevated rights.

Assumptions:
- First user automatically becomes admin (is_admin=True, role="admin")
- Anyone may register an account; new accounts are non-admin "user" by default
