"""
Smooth tool-schema contract — the single source of truth.

These models are the machine-readable form of docs/TOOL_SCHEMA.md. They
validate the wire on the server AND drive the client conformance suite, so a
client and the server cannot drift from the same definition.

Three sections, identical on every entity:
  internal   — server-owned (id, version, timestamps); read-only to clients
  canonical  — agreed truth; every leaf is a provenance-tagged Field
  clients    — per-client envelope + opaque data

See docs/TOOL_SCHEMA.md for the prose.
