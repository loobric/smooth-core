Logging utilities for Smooth.

Provides specialized logging functions for:
- Application logs (operational)
- Audit logs (compliance)
- Security logs (forensics)

Assumptions:
- All logs use structlog for structured output
- Sensitive data (passwords, API keys) are never logged
- Audit logs are immutable and retained for 7 years
