"""Schema migration spine.

A small, forward-only migration runner — no Alembic. It exists because
`create_all` creates missing *tables* but never alters existing ones, so an
upgrade that changes a table silently breaks a populated database. See
`docs/MIGRATIONS.md` for the full design.

Migrations live next to this module as `NNNN_name.py` files, each exposing
`revision`, `name`, and an idempotent `upgrade(conn)`. The applied set is
recorded in the `schema_migrations` ledger table, whose `MAX(revision)` is the
database's current schema version.
