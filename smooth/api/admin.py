"""
Admin-only, server-wide operations.

`wipe` is a FACTORY RESET: it deletes ALL data, ALL accounts, and ALL API keys —
including the administrator who calls it. After it runs the database is empty and
the next account to register becomes the new admin (first-user-is-admin). It
exists to return a shared/sandbox deployment to a clean slate in one call.

It is guarded two ways: admin-only, and the caller must echo an exact
confirmation phrase in the body. There is no undo.

Distinct from `POST /api/v1/account/reset`, which wipes only the caller's *tool
data* and keeps every account and key.
