"""
Account-level operations on the caller's own tool data.

Both endpoints here act ONLY on the authenticated caller's data (everything is
user-scoped), so they are owner-gated — any signed-in user may manage their own
account. (Cross-account/factory operations live behind admin gating elsewhere:
see `/api/v1/admin/wipe` and `/api/v1/backup/*`.)

- `reset` wipes all of the caller's tool data — instance/catalog records, tool
  sets, machines, tool-table entries, and open binding proposals — while keeping
  the account itself and its API keys. Return to a clean slate in one call.
- `seed-demo` does the inverse: it populates a fresh account with a small demo
  (a machine, a two-manufacturer catalog, a couple of physical tools, a tool
  set, and a pushed tool table) so a first-time visitor has something to explore
  without touching the CLI. It refuses on an account that already has tool data,
  and rolls back to the clean slate it started from if any step fails.
